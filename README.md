# AI-Powered Hospital Triage & Queue Management System

Problem: In many hospitals, patients are attended to on a first-come, first-served basis rather than according to the urgency of their condition. This
often results in long waits for critical patients and, in some cases, life-threatening delays. Manual triage performed by staff can be slow,
inconsistent, and highly dependent on available personnel, especially during peak hours or emergencies.

Expectation: Develop an AI-based triage system that allows patients or nurses to input symptoms via a webpage or tablet and automatically
assigns priority scores to arrange the hospital queue dynamically. The solution should be fast, user-friendly, and capable of integrating with
existing hospital workflows. Bonus features may include real-time alerts for doctors, and analytics for managing patient flow.
